Benefits of MVC

Separation of Concerns: Keeps code organized and maintainable by separating data logic, UI/API responses, and route handling.

Scalability: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones without breaking other parts of the app.

Reusability: Controllers and models can be reused across multiple routes or modules.

Testability: Each component can be unit tested independently (e.g., test only controllers using Supertest and Jest).

Why It Works in math-api-backend here

In a backend application like this (with mathematical APIs and database storage), the MVC pattern:

Keeps mathematical logic cleanly separated from DB code

Makes your API endpoints easier to manage and scale

Follows industry-standard best practices for Node.js projects
